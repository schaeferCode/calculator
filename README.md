Getting Started:

1. Clone repo
2. npm install
3. npm run webpack && npm start
4. In browser, navigate to localhost:8080

Some Issues:

1. The screen doesn't show multiple input numbers at a time, even though it is adding them to the input value.
2. The +/- button only works if you use it on the first number in a calculation.
3. Hitting the action buttons breaks the calculation.
